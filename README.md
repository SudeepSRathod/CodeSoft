**Python GUI Projects**
This repository contains three Python GUI applications: a Colorful Calculator, a Secure Password Generator, and a Contact Book. All applications are developed using the Tkinter library.

_Language and Libraries Used_
Programming Language
**Python**: All applications are written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
GUI Library
**Tkinter**: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. It provides a fast and easy way to create graphical user interfaces.
Additional Modules
random: Used in the Secure Password Generator to create random passwords.
string: Used in the Secure Password Generator to define character sets for password generation.
ttk (Themed Tkinter): Used in the Contact Book for enhanced widget styling, particularly for the Treeview widget.
tkinter.simpledialog: Used in the Contact Book to prompt user input through dialogs.
tkinter.messagebox: Used in the Contact Book to display error, warning, and information messages.

_Installation_
To run these projects, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from the official Python website.

No additional packages need to be installed as Tkinter and ttk are included with standard Python installations. However, ensure your environment is properly set up with Tkinter support.
